<h1 class="title">Following the Ketogenic Diet (KGD)</h1>
<div class="add-padding white-background">
  <p>The Ketogenic Diet is very high in fat. Consequently, it is low in carbohydrate. Protein is kept at an acceptable level, generally the RDA’s (Recommended Dietary Allowances) for the patient’s age/weight. The KGD is not a “healthy” diet, it is a Medical Nutrition Therapy. During the course of the diet patients will be required to take a vitamin/mineral supplement, a calcium supplement, a phosphorus supplement, a potassium supplement and other supplements deemed necessary by bloodwork (ie. Vitamin D, zinc, selenium, iron).</p>
  <p>In order to follow the KGD effectively, all foods must be weighed at each meal. The diet is prescribed by “ratios”, which describe the amount of fat given in comparison to the amount of carbohydrate and protein given. For example:</p>
  <p>2 grams fat: 1 gram (protein + carbohydrate)</p>
  <p>The final ratio prescribed will be determined by blood ketone levels and tolerance to the diet. When following the KGD, 100% of each meal should be eaten in order to attain the full potential of the diet. Even the bowls should be scraped to get every last drop/gram of fat, which is why spatulas are included in the "<a href="#!/kit">Keto Kit</a>”.</p>
  <p>While following the KGD, each meal will be pre-planned on <a href="http://ketocalculator.com">KetoCalculator.com</a>. Patients will be trained to use this website, and meals will be monitored by the dietitian. The database on the KetoCalculator program is quite extensive. Foods that are not on the website can be added to the database by the dietitian.</p>
  <p>While following the KGD, patients should take care to avoid any extra sources of carbohydrate in foods, or personal care products. The Charlie Foundation has an excellent resource list that is updated several times each year.  Please refer to <a href="http://www.charliefoundation.org/resources-tools/resources-3/low-carb">this list</a> for specific product recommendations while on the KGD.</p>  
  <p>If the many details of the KGD are starting to become overwhelming, you may have an appreciation as to why the diet must be attempted under the care of a dietitian that is experienced in administering the KGD. This diet is not to be undertaken lightly. If it is only done halfheartedly, it is unlikely that you will achieve the level of ketosis desired to potentially impact your cancer. 100% compliance is the goal.</p>

      <h2>Q and A</h2>
      <div id="faq">

        <p>Q. Why is the program so expensive/cheap?</p>
        <p>A. It is anticipated that the RD (Registered Dietitian) will spend approximately 15 hours working directly with each patient, their physician, or their case over the course of 3 months. Fair wages for a RD consultant are $100-$200/hour.</p>
        <p>Q. Will the diet cure my cancer, help my ALS/Parkinson’s/MS/Autism/etc?</p>
        <p>A. No one can answer that. There is enough evidence to make a trial of the KGD worthwhile for many people.</p>
        <p>Q. Is this a research study?</p>
        <p>A. No. But data will be collected and potentially published. By signing the release of liability form, you are also allowing Potter Dietitian Consulting, LLC and Denise Potter RD, CSP, CDE to use any data collected during your enrollment for research purposes.</p>
        <p>Q. Can I use the KGD for weight loss?</p>
        <p>A. You could, but it is not recommended. The KGD is not a balanced diet, nor is it considered to be “healthy”. It is a medical therapy that has been used to treat numerous diseases. While it is possible to lose weight this way, there is a high probability that you will regain any weight lost once you resume your previous diet.</p> 
        <p>Q. Why are all of the fees due near the beginning?</p>
        <p>A. The fee schedule is set up to reflect the RD involvement. A bulk of the hours are spent in preparation and initiation of the KGD.</p>
        <p>Q. Will insurance cover this program?</p>
        <p>A. No. Your health insurance carrier will not pay for an experimental treatment.</p>

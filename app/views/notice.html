<p><strong>The Ketogenic Diet</strong> is a medical therapy, most often used to treat patients with Medication Resistant Epilepsy.  When used to treat epilepsy, the KGD is closely monitored by dietitians, physicians, and the healthcare team.  When using the KGD as an experimental treatment for cancer, it should also be closely monitored, not undertaken by individuals without medical experience or access to routine lab work and necessary prescription supplements.</p>

  <h2>From 1923 to the present</h2>
  <p>There has been mounting evidence over recent years that the Ketogenic Diet (KGD) may have some beneficial effect on cancer. There are 15 research studies either ongoing, or taking participants, attempting to determine the effectiveness of the KGD for cancer treatment (see <a href="http://www.charliefoundation.org/discover-therapy-for/discover-2/brain-tumor-cancer">www.charliefoundation.org</a>).</p>
  <p>Research can be traced back to 1923, where Dr. Otto Wartburg “hypothesized that the primary cause of cancer was a dysfunctional metabolic process causing cancer cells to utilize large amounts of energy (glucose)” (from Charlie Foundation website). There was little done until 1995 when the Ketogenic/MCT Diet was used successfully by 2 patients with astrocytomas. Several studies since have supported the theory that the Ketogenic Diet may fight cancer by restricting the availability of one of its main fuel sources, glucose.</p>
  <p>The Ketogenic Diet is extremely high in fat and extremely low in carbohydrates. Protein is kept at a moderate amount, usually at the RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance). Eating foods in these proportions encourages the body to go into a state of “starvation”, in a sense. When carbohydrates are not available for energy, the body’s alternative fuel source is fat. Burning fat for energy creates byproducts call 'ketone bodies' which are used by the brain for fuel, hence the term, “Ketogenic Diet”.</p>
  <p>Dr. Dominic D’Agostino has been researching the effects of the KGD on cancer for the past several years. <a to-video href="/home">Watch a 10 minute talk</a> by Dr D'Agostino about the KGD and its potential benefit as a cancer treatment.</p>

  <p>The goal of Potter Dietitian Consulting, LLC is not to convince you that the KGD is going to cure cancer or any other condition. The goal is to provide a medically sound program where patients can follow the KGD correctly and discover for themselves if their life and health will be impacted in a positive way</p>

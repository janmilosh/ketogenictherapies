<div ng-controller="ContactFormController" class="faq white-background"><h1 class="faq title">Q &amp; A</h1><h2>Frequently asked questions</h2><div id="faq"><p>Q. Will the diet cure my cancer, help my ALS/Parkinson’s/MS/Autism/etc?</p><p>A. No one can answer that. There is enough evidence to make a trial of the KD worthwhile for many people.</p><p>Q. Is this a research study?</p><p>A. No, but data will be collected and potentially published. By signing the release of liability form, you are also allowing Potter Dietitian Consulting, LLC and Denise Potter RD, CSP, CDE to use any data collected during your enrollment for research purposes.</p><p>Q. Can I use the KD for weight loss?</p><p>A. You could, but it is not recommended. The KD is not a balanced diet, nor is it considered to be “healthy”. It is a medical therapy that has been used to treat numerous diseases. While it is possible to lose weight this way, there is a high probability that you will regain any weight lost once you resume your previous diet.</p><p>Q. Will insurance cover this program?</p><p>A. No. Your health insurance carrier will not pay for an experimental treatment.</p></div></div>
